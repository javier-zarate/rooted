      <h2>Automatic decision-making</h2>
      <p>
        If you are a resident of the EEA, you have the right to object to
        processing based solely on automated decision-making (which includes
        profiling), when that decision-making has a legal effect on you or
        otherwise significantly affects you.
      </p>
      <p>
        We&nbsp;DO NOT&nbsp;engage in fully automated decision-making that has a
        legal or otherwise significant effect using customer data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our processor Shopify uses limited automated decision-making to prevent
        fraud that does not have a legal or otherwise significant effect on you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Services that include elements of automated decision-making include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Temporary denylist of IP addresses associated with repeated failed
          transactions. This denylist persists for a small number of hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          Temporary denylist of credit cards associated with denylisted IP
          addresses. This denylist persists for a small number of days.

        The length of time that a cookie remains on your computer or mobile
        device depends on whether it is a &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; or
        &ldquo;session&rdquo; cookie. Session cookies last until you stop
        browsing and persistent cookies last until they expire or are deleted.
        Most of the cookies we use are persistent and will expire between 30
        minutes and two years from the date they are downloaded to your device.
